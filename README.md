# Scraping Project

In this project, I created a simple HTML/CSS website and hosted it online using Google Firebase. The website contains paragraphs that I copied and pasted from various online sources. 

To extract and process the content of the website, I used the `requests` and `Beautiful Soup` libraries in Python. These tools allowed me to parse through the website's content and print out the resulting text.
